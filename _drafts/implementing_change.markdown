>  Implementing Change

# Scale of Change

## Small

Try it and role model behaviour. e.g. Meeting notes, stand-up updates, adding AC to stories

## Large

Understand what you are changing and why, what impact it has, who is impacted, their concerns. With that you can adapt and implement change
that doesn't leave people behind.

## Job change

Why, what I like & dislike, strengths, experiences etc.
