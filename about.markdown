I currently work in the UK Civil Service at HM Land Registry(HMLR), as a test engineer and manager. Primarily working on agile teams delivering web-based citizen, professional, and internal facing services.

I am passionate about communities of practice. I believe that a strong, engaged community is the best way to support and develop a practice and its people. I am a core member of the HMLR test community, participating in and leading our regular community events and training. I represent the testing practice at “community of communities” events, which is where people from the different practices at HMLR come together to share ideas.

I've spoken at cross government testing events, and currently mentor someone from another department.

I work heavily in technical testing; writing automation, developing standards, maintaining useful artefacts (test skeletons, internal test guides, etc). I love to learn new things and share that with other people.

I'm comfortable working with; version control, Docker, CICD, cloud infrastructure and microservices to name a few things.

## Where I'm looking to grow
In short, I want to keep improving my testing and technical skills. I'm open to opportunities where we can learn from each other.

Some areas include:
- Programming
- Security
- Performance
- CICD

## What I bring

I am a quick learner, enjoy learning new things, and sharing that with other people. I've worked in different domains and organisations. I'm a advocate for communities, and keen to develop them where I can.

I'm passionate about developing high quality software for our users. This includes putting a focus on accessibility early in the journey, and keeping it as a primary focus.

I'm more than happy to speak to other people, and you can reach me in a few places.
