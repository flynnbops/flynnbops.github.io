Last week I ran my first lean coffee session with some testing folk across government. We had people from; [DWP](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions), [UKHO](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-hydrographic-office), [Ordnance Survey](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/), [department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education), [crown commercial service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/crown-commercial-service), [DVSA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-standards-agency), and me from [HM Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry). A good mix of people to be fair.

[Lean coffee](https://leancoffee.org/) is a great way to build an agenda with the attendees at the session. I trialled [lean coffee table](https://www.leancoffeetable.com/) for the session, and overall, it ran smoothly. Might work for your needs too.

**## Quick Disclaimer**

Before I go further, I do have a confession to make. This was my second attempt at running this event, and the first one that went ahead. The very first attempt was just me, and I learned that even for a quick experiment, a week or 2 notice is probably best.

I've decided to call that failed attempt "Session 0". So, with that footnote and the magic of [zero based numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering), we can continue to talk about "Session 1".

**## Why did I run the session**

I am huge believer in "communities" and had a feeling that there was appetite for more cross government collaboration. There had already been work done in this area pre-covid, so I really wanted to get things moving again. You can read more on the [UKHO blog](https://ukhodigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/24/working-across-government-to-improve-testing/).

This session let me try something fairly quick and lightweight. The positive response definitely warrants following up and seeing what more we can do together. All things going well, there'll be more posts on this theme in the coming months.

**## What did we talk about**

After some quick introductions, to break the ice we covered some topics that brought out different views and experiences. Some looking like good topics for follow up sessions.

** Topics coverage **

Of course, the conversation wasn't without controversy. One topic threatened to end this fledgling community before we gained any real momentum, and cause a cross government schism.

** Tea vs Coffee

**## What did we learn?**

In the simplest terms, we got to meet other people in similar roles across government and share some ideas.

To (badly) paraphrase [Alan Page](https://angryweasel.com/blog/about-alan/):

> Best way to get good ideas, is to get lots of ideas, and throw away the bad ones

I wouldn't say we covered any bad ideas, but we have seen how we can work together for fresh perspectives, and the potential to collaborate more in future.
