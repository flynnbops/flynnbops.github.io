> Original WIP version posted 3rd November 2021

Last year I spoke at a `South West Test` online meetup. This was my first public speaking engagement. The format of shorter talks definitely helped. I have spoken before at community sessions, or cross-gov meet ups. So talking about something wasn't totally alien. You can check out mine (staring around the 16 minute mark) and all the other speakers [in the recording](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/lightning-talk-bonanza).

## Why did I talk?

It's a bit weird to write about a talk, where I talked about writing. Feels indulgent at worst, and repetitive at best. That being said, it's not easy to hear from people who are early in a journey. At least in my experience. There is a big leap from doing a `Hello World` tutorial, to building something complex. Similarly, I've seen lots of content from great writers, but not as much from people trying to get stared. Maybe, thats a problem with where I look, or it's harder to find that content.

> Be brave enough to suck at something new

That's why I spoke about writing. To share my experiences of trying something new, and how it's worked out so far. Even if I was (and still am) fumbling around with it all.

## What have I done since?
Well I've not done much writing here to be honest...

I've been doing some cool things at work, which have given me ideas. I gave a proper lightning talk version of this talk at another event. Shortening the time and still sharing something, was a challenge.

### But other people have...
Some people actually started their own blogs as a result of my talk! Which is an incredible result.
