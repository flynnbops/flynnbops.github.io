[MOT Bloggers Club October 2023][1]

> How do you approach continuous learning?

This is my first post in a long time. Lots of interesting life stuff happened over the past few months. Including my wedding and our "Family-moon" adventure.
I'm leaning on the MoT Bloggers club (as usual) to help get me back writing. Getting started again can be hard.

## How much do I want / need to learn?
> `the thing` could be an approach, tool, technology, domain, etc

This question helps me figure out what my learning goal is, and from there what route I can take.
It's classic "it depends" territory. Sometimes I need just enough knowledge to know `a thing` exists, other times I need to know how to use `the thing` in my team.
I like to use `skill levels` to help me define the depth I might need. I use a modified version of [Gov UK Skill levels for digital, data and technology roles][2].

### Skill levels
Generally, going from "no Awareness" to "Awareness" should be simple enough. Things like introductions or overviews to "the thing", often are enough.
As you spend more time using `the thing` you'll move into "Working" and beyond.
I use this as a guide rather than being overly strict with the levels. "All models are useful ..." etc.

- Awareness
  - You know about the skill
  - Have an appreciation of how it is applied in the environment
- Working 
  - You can apply your knowledge and experience of the skill including tools and techniques. 
  - You can adopt those most appropriate for the environment, with support.
- Practitioner 
  - Share your knowledge and experience of this skill with others e.g. tools and techniques 
  - Define most appropriate thing for the environment
- Champion 
  - Knowledge and experience 
  - Recognised specialist 
  - Adviser: user needs, generation of ideas, methods and tools 
  - Lead or guide others in better practices and new ideas

## What works well for me?

I like to consume different forms of information, and find the variety helps me learn. This ranges from; blogs, documentation, videos, podcasts, training courses, to random chats with people.
I find a decent foundation (awareness), means I'm primed to take in more information. Thankfully there's lots of great content out there for people to consume, so I can easily check something out, and move on if it doesn't suit me.

I've had my best successes when I align my learning with a goal. As I've already alluded to.
A recent example is how I [learned more about Docker so that I could solve a specific problem][4]. I'd worked with Docker for a few years at that point, but generally just used the basics. 
Having a specific problem to solve helped me learn more without getting overwhelmed. 

I'm guilty of being inconsistent with my "deliberate learning". Having goals, helps me figure out a path forward, and with that make some regular time to work towards the goal.
As with most things consistency is key, and that's where I tend to fall down with my `continous learning`.

## What support do I use?
I try to read and learn from interesting people. Often saving things I've found useful into a [small repo references][3]. 
I like to see what pathways others have already created, and see how they work for me. Some are just what I'm looking, while others I cherry pick parts.

For example:
- [MoT learning journeys][5]
- [TAU learning paths][6]
