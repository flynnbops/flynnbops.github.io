>  In testing, I have changed my mind about ...  most things

Another great topic, that makes you really think about how you've changed over time.

Pretty much everything I ever believed about testing has changed over time. I'm a better tester (and person) as a result.
Let's have a look at some clickbait soundbites, which could be whole posts in their own right. 
Before a deeper dive into what brought about changes.

# Former testing beliefs
- Testers are gate keepers
- Testing happens at the end
- A testers job is to find bugs
- Automate through the UI
- Record and playback tools suck (yet to revisit)
  - I'm curious about how newer tools perform
- I don't want to be in management
  - Followed by a stint in management where I learned a lot
- Lots of test documentation is needed
  - Balance needed here. But I love mind maps and other handy-dandy diagrams
- Testing courses are expensive and tied to certificates
  - Tonnes of free and affordable training is available
- ISTQB are the supreme authority on testing
  - Have since tempered that with experience and different schools of thought

# What led to these changes?
When I reflect on my career so far, there are key points where my views changed.

## Being part of a Community
Internal (organisations) and External (online)
- Similar people, in different places.
- Loads of knowledge shared
- Different ideas and view points
- Better ways of doing things

Initially I found MoT, I joined and observed for a long time. It's not until recently that I've become more active.
That's the great thing about communities. There are many ways to "be a part" of a community. 
I've covered it in more depth recently at the [MOT club](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/what-do-people-do-as-part-of-the-ministry-of-testing-community/59160/8?u=azza554), which deserves its own blog post.

## Writing
I've written and spoken about this before so, I won't go into great detail.
But in short, writing publicly is great, for new ideas and collaborating with people.

## People management

When I started managing people, I was out of my comfort zone. I was in a position without the skills I needed.
Something I wrote about in my chapter 'What is my role?' in [Testing Stories](https://leanpub.com/testing_stories).

> Reflecting on who we really are as people is hard (...)
> I looked at things like Myers-Briggs and StrengthsFinders. I personally found these frameworks useful.

I looked for other ideas and perspectives, to help me figure out my values and some helpful techniques. 
Finding ideas like [modern testing](https://moderntesting.org/) and [servant leadership](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/servant-leadership.htm) resonate, and influence my approach.
