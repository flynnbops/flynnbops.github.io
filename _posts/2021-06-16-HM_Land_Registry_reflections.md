This week marks the end of my five and a half years working with [HM Land Registry(HMLR)][1]. During that time, I've worked as a  junior consultant, test analyst, and test ~~wizard~~ manager. I've been lucky to work with a diverse range of talented people across different teams and practices. Unsurprisingly I'll miss the great people. Both at HMLR and other departments.

I've worked with many of the teams / projects in some capacity. Whether that's been as part of the team or working with people through the community. To say I've learned a lot from you would be a huge understatement.

My heartfelt thanks to everyone who has helped me over the years. Your expertise and guidance were (and still are) invaluable. I've been in a place to repay that kindness to some people directly. Or pay it forward through the communities.

I've already covered [my thoughts on the testing community][2] in more detail.  The communities of practice and interest at HMLR are great places to collaborate. It's been a privilege to contribute and see them evolve.

Best of luck to you all. I've no doubt you'll all do great things as people, and as an organisation.

## A couple of highlights
- Working on the LLC programme from Alpha to Private Beta.
- Speaking about accessibility at a cross gov testing meetup. And cross government work in general.
- All the communities!
- Learning from and teaching people over the years.
- Helping people as a line manager.
- Seeing different people progress in their careers.

Take care 

Aaron
